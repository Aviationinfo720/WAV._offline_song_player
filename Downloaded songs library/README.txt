IMPORTANT NOTES:
1) Please only insert .wav files in the songs file only as the python code can work with .wav files!
2) Please make sure that the file name is written in all caps to make the code run.
   It takes the input and automatically capitalise every word for you!
3) Most instructions are based on a Windows computer keyboard, so if you are a MACOS user or having a totally different keyboard layout
   you may need to take some time googling the keybinds for mac or you keyboard layout (i dont think you need to google
   anything becuase the controlls are just simple space bar and single word inputs but you may need to see how to copy a file path!)  

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
1) As usual the space bar covers both the play and pause button!
2) When you open (Downloaded songs library.py), go to line 8 and change the path to the song file path which came with the Download.
3) To add songs, put the song files inside the "songs" file. The code will automatically pick the song up from the file when runned!
4) Sit back and relax, do not try to type or play any game which involves the space bar as the song will pause and play even tough
   the window is hidden.

5) Optional: If you want to make the wav player so that it will say in the prompt wether the song is paused or playing, go to line 7
   and put "True" instead of "False"!

And last thing, there are 2 songs included in this github project to test! Enjoy the downloaded songs player! You can use this code 
anywhere with downloaded songs wether you are at home, away or offline!

(but still, i would recomend you the built in music player in your device or spotify premium (if you have) to play songs offline!ðŸ˜…)
